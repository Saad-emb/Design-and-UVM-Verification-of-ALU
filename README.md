# Design-and-UVM-Verification-of-ALU

In this repository, you will find the design and UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) verification code for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

 ## Objectives
#### Design ALU: 
- Create a fully functional Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with various operations 
#### Understand UVM 
- Gain an understanding of the Universal Verification Methodology and its key concepts, 
#### Verify ALU Functionality
- Develop a comprehensive verification environment using UVM to thoroughly test the ALU's functionality, ensuring it performs operations accurately.
